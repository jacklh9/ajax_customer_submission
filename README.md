201905 code test.

The above code is running here: [https://jacklh-ctest.herokuapp.com](https://jacklh-ctest.herokuapp.com/)

A note about above webapp:
Since the above runs on a free-tier Heroku VM, please be:
- patient while Heroku spins up the VM from sleep-mode.
- aware that Heroku uses containers, which means that image data will not persist when they reboot the VM.
- database data WILL persist.
