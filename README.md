# ajax_customer_submission

A 201905 PHP/Ajax/Bootstrap code test.


The above code is running here: [https://jacklh-ctest.herokuapp.com](https://jacklh-ctest.herokuapp.com/)


A note about above webapp:
Since the above runs on a free-tier Heroku VM, please be patient while Heroku spins up the VM from sleep-mode.


In addition, it's worth-noting all data files are stored on Amazon's S3 servers. All generated URLs for file and image access are pre-signed to expire after 15 minutes. (It also means your session times out after 15 minutes--an arbitrary value defined as a constant in the code.)

NOTE: For any would-be hackers, let me save you the trouble--all Host/DB/S3 passwords recorded during the video were immediately reset prior to uploading video. Sorry, not sorry.  ;-)
